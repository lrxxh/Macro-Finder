# Macro Finder
This is a simple Python script that should find any macro location for most popular mice. If you face any issues or need help with something, feel free to DM me at lrxh#0001.

# Want to compile the src to an .exe yourself?

1. Download MacroDetector.py and put it in a new folder.

2. After that, open cmd in the same direcotry and type
```pyinstaller MacroDetector.py --onefile```

3. Now you should have multiple folders generated. Click on **Dist**, and inside there should be the .exe.


# Notes!

• The .exe will false flag any antivirus.

• The .py file should never flag anything on any antivirus.
